  <p>AIMSWIS provides a huge diversity of events and offers from which the students can benefit.
Next to the In-House Women&rsquo;s Mentorship program which includes panel discussions, public lectures and skill workshops among others, emphasis is also put on outreach.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="in-house-women-s-mentorship">In-House Women&rsquo;s Mentorship</h3>

<p><strong>One-to-One Matching:</strong> The program pairs an AIMS student (the mentee) with an AIMS alumna or researcher (the mentor). Besides providing general support throughout the year, an important goal is to expand the menteeâ€™s network of other Women in STEM.</p>

<p>What does that mean for the mentors? They guide the female students to obtain their desired outcomes concerning their research interests.</p>

<p>The mentors&rsquo; main task is to share their life experience in questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to find out what I am interested in?</li>
<li>Academia vs Industry?</li>
<li>How to find positions after AIMS?</li>
<li>How to apply for positions after AIMS?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in becoming a mentor, please email <a href="mailto:outreach@aims.ac.za">outreach@aims.ac.za</a></p>

<p><strong>Mentoring Lunches:</strong> The mentoring lunch provides AIMS women students and researchers with an informal opportunity to discuss their career journeys and developments, share knowledge and life experiences as women scientists. It establishes relationships between young female students and women scientist visiting AIMS working as role models.</p>

<p><strong>Career talks, panel discussion &amp; public lectures:</strong> There are many questions shared by almost everybody. Why not giving them a platform to be discussed in a group rather than individually? In talks, panel discussions and public lectures, everybody gets a voice to ask and discuss or the opportunity to gain a new perspective. Either a group or an individual invites speaker is keen to share knowledge and ideas. Furthermore, these opportunities raise the profile of women engaged in science for social work.</p>

<p><strong>Skill workshop:</strong> The female students gain more confidence knowing their strengths and weaknesses and working on their skills. Creating a network, identifying priorities, setting career goals and improving time management are central points of the workshops&rsquo; content.</p>

<h3 id="outreach">Outreach</h3>

<p><strong>Career talks, panel discussion &amp; public lectures:</strong> Talks, discussions and lectures are also provided as outreach opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media Campaign:</strong> Within social media campaigns, students and researchers get the opportunity to send a message to young African girls through social media according to the motto: &ldquo;Everybody gets a voice and make a difference!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Job Shadowing:</strong>
We want to inspire and stimulate an interest in girls to pursue a study in STEM subjects at University. Therefore, school learners are invited to visit AIMS and its researchers and encouraged to ask them questions such as:
* What do you do as a researcher?
* What are the applications and what is the importance of mathematics?
* How did you become a researcher?</p>

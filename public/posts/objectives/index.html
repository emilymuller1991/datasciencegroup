  <p>The key object is to empower female students at AIMS South Africa to achieve their full potential.
Furthermore, AIMSWIS intends to train a generation of women scientists as mentors to increase the number of role models for girls in African communities. Finally, AIMSWIS wishes to create a space for women students in mathematical sciences.</p>

<p></p>

<p>These objectives can be summarized in five key points:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Encourage</strong> women and girls to pursue careers in the STEM.</li>
<li><strong>Supply</strong> AIMS women students and researchers with a network of successful women professionals in STEM including AIMS alumni.</li>
<li><strong>Provide</strong> a platform for AIMS (both male and female) students to actively engage in the community by mentoring at local schools.</li>
<li><strong>Provide</strong> regularly information to students outlining career and funding opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Create</strong> a safe space for women students where they obtain support from senior students and mentors who serve as role models and help them develop their life skills and build self-confidence. Within this space, ideas, challenges and opportunities can be shared, solutions can be sought and progress can be made.</li>
</ul>

<p>Emphasis is not only put on being a mentee, but also becoming a mentor. This is encouraged by the support provided by AIMSWIS for AIMS students all the way until they become an alumna.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The AIMS Women in Stem Initiative (AIMSWIS) is crucial and beneficial to Africa&rsquo;s innovative capacity and global competitiveness since the social and economic inclusion of women plays a huge role in economic growth.&rdquo;</em> Ms. Palesa Motsoeneng, (Assistant Director, DST Multilateral Cooperation and Africa)</p>
